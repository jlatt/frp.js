# Functional Reactive Programming for Javascript
Inspiration comes from:
- [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)
- [Flapjax](http://www.flapjax-lang.org/)

## Why not Elm?
Elm is really cool, but it's Haskell that compiles to Javascript. Transpiling gives me the willies.

## Why not Flapjax?
Flapjax is also cool, but it's self-contained and looks like it was written by Haskellers. 

## My Goals
- Make use of [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) to avoid reinventing common functions.
- Bind to the dom with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).
- Provide utilities for binding to [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference).
