Transpiling gives me the willies.\r\n\r\n## Why not Flapjax?\r\nFlapjax is also cool, but it's self-contained and looks like it was written by Haskellers. \r\n\r\n## My Goals\r\n- Make use of [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to avoid reinventing common functions.\r\n- Provide utilities for binding to [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference).\r\n"}
